This app presents a geospatial analysis of patterns of politically motivated detention practices in Egypt. Given the limited visibility into the country's criminal justice system, trend analysis such as this is an important facet of human rights documentation and accountability efforts. The 420 detainees whose data is analyzed here represent just a small portion of the over 65,000 Egyptian political prisoners subjected to similar abuses. While this analysis offers valuable insights into detention patterns, it should be viewed as a snapshot based on a limited sample of cases rather than a comprehensive assessment of all detention practices across the country. The code produces an interactive R Shiny app for exploring the data, with a separate analysis script also included for conducting additional statistical analyses. Data on detentions was provided by a partner human rights organization. Socioeconomic indicators were sourced from the Global Data Lab.
