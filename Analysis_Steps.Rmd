# Data Acquistion

Data for this project was sourced from two sources. Socioeconomic data was 
sourced from the Global Data Lab. Data on detention came from an associated 
partner human rights organization with a focus on case documentation. 

# Data Cleaning

Data Cleaning and Data Analysis were conducted in separate scripts in order to 
keep the workflows separate and to avoid accidentally overwriting the clean data.
